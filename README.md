# Teleprinter
## Overview
This toy project takes football results from [football-data.co.uk] and outputs them via a fake Teleprinter (see [this Wikipedia article on the Vidiprinter for those too young to remember Grandstand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidiprinter)).

It is one of the inputs to the toy Apache Flink [in this same github project](https://github.com/sih/flinkball).

## Running
Run the Simulator class to iterate over all the data files (from 1993 to the current season, 2017/18). Note that the data files contain more data later on but even the original files have enough key info to use as output.
